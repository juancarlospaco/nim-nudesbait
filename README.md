# FAQ

- Why not just use a ZIP?.

This is designed to be very light weight but very tempting for Scammers.

This is can be used as a "Trust test", if you say someone Not to browse your files and you prove that person browsed your Nude photos.

ZIP can be Previewed as a normal folder nowadays, breaking the illusion of a Bait.

Compressed file extraction tends to be verbose, show progress, list extracted files, show GUI, breaking the illusion of a Bait.

If you have someone overseeing over Remote Desktop TeamViewer/LogMeIn/etc they will notice the extraction of a ZIP.
