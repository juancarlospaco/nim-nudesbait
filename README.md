# NudesBait

- Make **Fake** *"Nudes"* folders using tiny Wikipedia images (3 per folder) on [NimScript](https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/nims.html) to use as [harrasing wankers *"Bait"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scam_baiting)

# Use

```console
nim nudesbait.nims
```

**OR**

```console
nim c -r nudesbait2.nim
```

- Requires Internet connection and `curl` (wont use too much disk nor network). [The idea is to use it as wankers Bait.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scam_baiting)
- Disable Folder Thumbnails, leave PC alone for a minute, record the activity somehow. You can delete the script after.
- You can also ZIP it and send it to someone asking for **unwanted** *Send Nudes*. Ideas and Pull Requests welcome.
- `nudesbait2.nim` can generate standalone single-file native binary executable for Windows/Linux. All files are harmless.
